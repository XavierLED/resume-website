    <p>I built a fully customizable Connect 4 experience in Java that breaks free from traditional rules while mastering core programming concepts.

        <h4>Key Features That Set It Apart</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Dynamic Board Rules</h5>
                Customizable grid size (any width/height)<br>
                Adjustable win conditions (connect N tiles)<br>
                Innovative L-Shaped Wins: Players must form both a straight line and a perpendicular piece - a fresh twist on classic gameplay<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Smart AI Opponents</h5>
                Three difficulty levels to challenge both casual and strategic players<br>
                Efficient move evaluation using procedural algorithms<br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Technical Challenges & Breakthroughs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>The Sliding Window Solution</h5>
                Developed an efficient win-checking system using a sliding window approach<br>
                Solved the tricky diagonal (/) check through careful boundary condition handling<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Rule Complexity Management</h5>
                Implemented clean static methods to handle:<br>
                Variable board configurations<br>
                Multiple win conditions (including the L-rule)<br>
                AI decision logic<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Procedural Programming Mastery</h5>
                Built the entire game using static methods<br>
                Created scalable logic that adapts to any board size<br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why This Project Stands Out</h4>
Went beyond basic Connect 4 to explore game design possibilities
Strengthened core Java skills in: Control flow, Array manipulation,

Algorithm optimization,

Proved that constraints (static methods only) can spark creativity.

Sometimes reinventing a classic teaches you the most and about coding.<br><br>
