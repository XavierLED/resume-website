    <h3>Fitness Tracker | Java, JavaFX, JUnit, Git/GitLab</h3>
        <hr class="col-3 my-4">
    <div class="col-lg-8 px-0">
    <p> I collaborated with a team to develop a desktop fitness tracker that lets users create, manage, and track workouts complete with exercises, sets, reps, and weight logging. My primary focus was on the backend architecture, ensuring data was stored efficiently and methods were robust, while also contributing to the JavaFX GUI and unit testing.<br><br>
    <h4>Key Features & Tech Stack</h4>
        <ul><li>JavaFX for the interactive, user-friendly interface (our first time building a GUI!).</li>
            <li>JUnit for rigorous unit testing, ensuring every method worked as intended.</li>
            <li>GitLab for version control and team collaboration.</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented Design to keep the codebase clean, reusable, and scalable.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h4>The Challenges</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Team Dynamics</h5>
This was our biggest group project yet, and it came with hurdles: team members dropping out, uneven effort, and communication gaps.
How we adapted: Through persistent discussions, task redistribution, and accountability checks, we rallied and delivered a working product.
            </li>
            <li><h5>Frontend-Backend Integration</h5>
Designing the GUI was one thing; making it talk to the backend logic was another. We used a visual design tool to speed up UI creation, but syncing data flows required careful planning.
            </li>
            <li><h5>Testing & Reliability</h5>
                Writing JUnit tests for every method forced us to think critically about edge cases and functionality turning "it works on my machine" into "it works, period."
            </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
        <p>
            Teamwork > Talent: A disjointed team can stall even simple projects clear roles and communication saved us.
OOP Pays Off: Structuring code properly from the start made debugging and scaling easier.
GUIs Are Deceptive: What looks simple on the surface often hides complex backend interactions.
This project wasnâ€™t just about fitness tracking it was about building resilience, both in code and in collaboration.
