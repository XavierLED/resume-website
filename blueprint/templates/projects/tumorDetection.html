    <p>I developed a deep learning system that analyzes brain MRI scans to detect tumors with 94% accuracy, combining computer vision with healthcare applications.
        <h4>Technical Implementation</h4><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Built a CNN from Scratch</h5>
                Designed a convolutional neural network in PyTorch to process medical images<br>
                Optimized layers and hyperparameters through iterative testing<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Data & Performance</h5>
                Trained on real-world MRI datasets (healthy vs. tumor scans)<br>
                Achieved 94% classification accuracy through:<br>
                Careful layer architecture tuning<br>
                Strategic data augmentation<br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Challenges & Breakthroughs</h4><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Medical Data Nuances</h5>
                Learned to work with specialized DICOM/medical image formats<br>
                Addressed dataset imbalances through augmentation<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Model Optimization</h5>
                Experimented with different kernel sizes and pooling layers<br>
                Balanced precision and recall for clinical relevance<br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
Proved I can apply deep learning to real-world problems
        Gained experience with:<br>
Computer vision for medical imaging,
PyTorch's full pipeline (from data loading to prediction),
Ethical considerations in medical AI.
Building this wasn't just about accuracy percentages - it was about understanding how AI could one day assist doctors in life-saving work.
