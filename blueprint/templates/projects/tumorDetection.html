    <p>I developed a deep learning system that analyzes brain MRI scans to detect tumors with 94% accuracy, combining computer vision with healthcare applications.
Technical Implementation
ðŸ§  Built a CNN from Scratch
Designed a convolutional neural network in PyTorch to process medical images
Optimized layers and hyperparameters through iterative testing
ðŸ“Š Data & Performance
Trained on real-world MRI datasets (healthy vs. tumor scans)
Achieved 94% classification accuracy through:
Careful layer architecture tuning
Strategic data augmentation
Key Challenges & Breakthroughs
Medical Data Nuances
Learned to work with specialized DICOM/medical image formats
Addressed dataset imbalances through augmentation
Model Optimization
Experimented with different kernel sizes and pooling layers
Balanced precision and recall for clinical relevance
Why This Matters
Proved I can apply deep learning to real-world problems
Gained experience with:
Computer vision for medical imaging
PyTorch's full pipeline (from data loading to prediction)
Ethical considerations in medical AI
"Building this wasn't just about accuracy percentages - it was about understanding how AI could one day assist doctors in life-saving work."
Skills Demonstrated
PyTorch framework mastery
CNN architecture design
Medical image preprocessing
Model evaluation and validation
