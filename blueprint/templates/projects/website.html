    <h3>Resume Website | Flask, Python, Git/GitHub, HTML, BootStrap, Docker</h3>

    <p>When I decided to build this website, I had zero web development experience. My only interaction with websites? Using them. So jumping into building one from scratch was equal parts thrilling and daunting.<br><br>
    <h4>Why Flask?</h4>
    I chose Flask because it gave me just enough structure to start without overwhelming me. Python was my comfort zone, and Flask let me focus on learning core web concepts (routing, templates, deployment) without getting lost in complexity.<br><br>
    <h4>The Challenges (and How I Tackled Them)</h4><br>
    <ul><li><h5>Outdated Tutorials & Missing Pieces</h5>
            Most Flask tutorials I found were outdated or skipped critical steps. After digging, I found a solid foundation but it left out all the CSS, JavaScript, and polish.<br><br>
        My fix? I learned on the fly:<br>
    Added dynamic features (like the "Show More/Less" buttons).
            Styled everything from the navigation bar to the footer trial and error until it felt clean and professional using BootStrap as a guide.</li><br>
        <li><h5>Deployment: From Local to Global</h5>
    Getting the site live was its own adventure. I used Docker to containerize the app and deployed it to a cloud server.
            Lesson learned: DevOps is its own beast, but now I know how to ship code beyond my laptop.</li></ul><br>
    <h4>Why This Matters</h4><br>
This wasn’t just about building a portfolio site. It was about proving I could:
Teach myself a totally new skill (web dev).
Problem-solve when resources fell short.
Ship something real, not just follow a tutorial.
And honestly? I’m hooked. Now I’m eyeing React for the frontend and more complex backends because the best projects are the ones that leave you hungry for more.
