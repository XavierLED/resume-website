    <h3>Resume Website | Flask, Python, Git/GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
    <p>After a long school year, I used this classic game to reignite my Python skills through progressive iterations:
Project Evolution
1️⃣ Terminal Version
Built core game logic with clean, efficient Python
Implemented input validation and win condition checking
Focused on writing maintainable, well-structured code
2️⃣ Tkinter GUI Upgrade
Transformed the console game into an interactive visual experience
Learned event-driven programming patterns
Designed an intuitive user interface from scratch
3️⃣ AI Opponent
Developed a basic "robot" player using simple decision algorithms
Created adjustable difficulty levels for varied challenges
Key Takeaways
Reinforced fundamentals through practical reimplementation
Bridged classroom knowledge with personal projects
Rediscovered coding joy by rebuilding a familiar concept with fresh eyes
"Sometimes the best way to move forward is to revisit the basics - with new perspective and sharper skills."
