    <h3>Resume Website | Flask, Python, Git/GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
    <p class="fs-5">I built this project to deepen my understanding of web interactions in Python, focusing on two powerful tools:
Core Tools & Skills
✔ Python Requests - Learned proper API consumption and HTTP methods
✔ Beautiful Soup - Mastered HTML parsing to extract precise elements
✔ Web Navigation - Implemented link discovery and page redirection logic
How It Works
Sends intelligent requests to target websites
Parses HTML responses with surgical precision
Identifies and follows relevant links automatically
Why This Mattered
Solidified my web scraping fundamentals
Gained practical experience with real-world data extraction
Discovered how to navigate websites programmatically
"What began as a simple exercise in HTTP requests became a gateway to understanding the web's underlying structure."
