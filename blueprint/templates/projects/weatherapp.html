    <p> When I started this project, I had a confession to make: I didn’t actually know what an API was. I’d heard the term thrown around, knew it was important, but had never worked with one directly. That changed when I built this Python weather app using OpenWeatherMap’s API my gateway into the world of web services and real-time data.<br>
    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users input a city name.
        </li>
        <li>
            The app fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap’s API.
        </li>
        <li>
            Returns the forecast in a clean, simplified format.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What I Learned (the Hard Way)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>Making API Requests</h5>
                My biggest hurdle? Figuring out how to actually talk to the API. The requests library in Python seemed straightforward.<br>
            Breakthrough: After digging into documentation (and a few failed attempts), I finally got my first successful response.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Decoding JSON</h5>
                When the API returned a wall of text, I realized: Oh, this is JSON.<br>
            Once I understood how to parse it with Python’s json library, extracting data (like temperature, humidity, etc.) became effortless.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Why This Project Mattered</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
First API integration proof I could work with external data.
        </li>
        <li>
Problem-solving from scratch no tutorials, just docs and trial/error.
        </li>
        <li>
Foundational knowledge for future projects (REST, error handling, etc.).
            </li><br>
        <p>It started with a simple question (“How do I even use this thing?”) and ended with a working app and a lot more confidence.</p>
