    <h3>Resume Website | Flask, Python, Git/GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
    <p>I built this command-line to-do list manager as my inaugural Go project—a practical way to learn the language’s quirks while creating something useful.
Key Features
✔ CLI-powered task management (add/delete/list tasks)
✔ Command-line flags for intuitive function calls
✔ Persistent storage to save tasks between sessions
The Go Learning Curve
Syntax Shifts: Adapting to Go’s strict formatting, error handling (if err != nil everywhere!), and explicit typing
Compilation Challenges: Debugging runtime errors that only appeared after building
Toolchain Familiarity: Learning go mod, the build process, and Go’s opinionated project structure
Why This Project Mattered
Proved I could quickly learn a new language’s idioms
Solidified understanding of CLI app architecture
Discovered Go’s strengths for small, performant utilities
"Go’s simplicity is deceptive—it rewards careful design and punishes sloppy thinking. I’m hooked."
What’s Next
Adding deadlines and priorities
Experimenting with concurrent task processing (goroutines!)
